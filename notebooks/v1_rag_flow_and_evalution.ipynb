Provide an example.\\n   - How can you use a subquery to filter records in the outer query?\\n\\n2. **Joins:**\\n   - Explain the differences between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.\\n   - How would you return records that have matching entries in two tables along with unmatched records from one table?\\n\\n3. **Set Operations:**\\n   - What are SQL set operations and when would you use UNION vs UNION ALL?\\n   - How do INTERSECT and EXCEPT work in SQL?\\n\\n4. **Aggregations and Group By:**\\n   - How does the GROUP BY clause work, and how would you use it to find the total revenue per customer?\\n   - Can you filter groups in an SQL query? If so, how?\\n\\n5. **Indexes:**\\n   - What are the different types of indexes in SQL and in what scenarios would you use each?\\n   - How do indexes affect performance, both positively and negatively?\\n\\n6. **Performance Tuning:**\\n   - What strategies can be used to optimize an SQL query for better performance?\\n   - How would you analyze a query plan to understand performance bottlenecks?\\n\\n7. **Stored Procedures and Functions:**\\n   - What is the difference between a stored procedure and a function in SQL?\\n   - How can you pass parameters to a stored procedure?
